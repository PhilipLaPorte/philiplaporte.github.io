  A map $\Delta^n\to \mathbb{R}^m$ which is not affine-linear but preserves straight line segments. These arise when writing the payoff vector of a repeated game as a function of one player's randomized action at a given history. All other strategy components must be fixed. I first saw this interesting property for $2\times 2$ games in <a href='https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspa.2018.0819' target='_blank'>McAvoy and Nowak 2019</a>. It has a neat proof for discounted Markov decision processes, with vector-valued payoffs based on the current state.
