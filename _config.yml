name: Philip LaPorte
tagline: mathematics phd candidate, uc berkeley
career-objective: I am a third-year graduate student at UC Berkeley, co-advised by <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~evans/" target="_blank">Steven Evans</a> and <a href="https://www.martinnowak.com/" target="_blank">Martin Nowak</a> (Harvard). I am interested in the mathematics of evolution, especially evolutionary game theory and social behavior. Recently I have been working on repeated games and direct reciprocity. I am very grateful to be supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
